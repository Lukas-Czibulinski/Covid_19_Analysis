# Covid_19_Analysis

An indepth Analysis of the real world data of Covid-19 which was taken from the official website "https://ourworldindata.org". <br>
The dataset was downloaded in February of 2023 and therefore has data until that date. For the purpose of this project it has been split into two subsets within MicrosoftExcel named "CovidDeaths" and "CovidVaccinations". <br>
After splitting into subsets the data has been loaded with HeidiSQL into a MySQL workbench environment. An exploratory data analysis within this environment has been performed after that. <br> 
With these outputs anothr SQL-queries has been performed in order to build a Tableau Dashboard which can be found on my Tableau Public account: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lukas.czibulinski.
